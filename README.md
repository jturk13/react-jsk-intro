Part 1:

You're tasked with creating three components:

FirstComponent: This component renders a main heading (h1) with the text "My very first component".
NamedComponent: This component renders a paragraph (p) which takes a property called "name" and displays the text "My name is [name]".
App: This component renders a container (div) that includes instances of both FirstComponent and NamedComponent.
Part 2:

You need to define a Tweet component. It should accept props such as the username, name, date, and message of a tweet. Then, create an App component that renders at least three instances of the Tweet component. Also, style the Tweet component using CSS classes.

Part 3:

Now, create a component called Person. Inside this component, render a paragraph tag that says "Learn some information about this person". Each Person should have properties for name and age. If the person is over 18, display an additional heading (h3) that says "please go vote!". Otherwise, display a heading saying "you must be 18". If the person's name is longer than 8 characters, only display the first six characters of their name.

Additionally, add a property called "hobbies" to the Person component which accepts an array of hobbies (strings). The Person component should list each hobby as a list item (li). Lastly, create an App component that renders at least three copies of the Person component, each with different information.
